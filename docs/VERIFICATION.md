# Verification record — Phase 1 (2026-11-06)

Every number in this file was measured on 2026-11-06 by running the
stated command in the stated environment. Nothing here is copied from
an earlier run. `docs/CLAIMS.yaml` cites this file where a claim's
evidence is a measured run rather than a single test.

## Environment

- Machine: Linux VM, Python **3.12.3** (`python3` only; no bare `python` binary).
- Bare verification venv: `python3 -m venv` + `pip install -e ".[dev]"`,
  then `pip install -e ".[security]"` for the audit tools. `/tmp` is a
  512 MB tmpfs, so installs used `TMPDIR=<repo>/.tmp PIP_NO_CACHE_DIR=1`.
- Repo HEAD at measurement time: `efc198c` (rewritten history, canonical
  identity `Stratos <28989754+strmt7@users.noreply.github.com>`).
- The `textforensics` console script is only resolvable when the venv's
  `bin/` is on `PATH`; invoking pytest via the venv python without that
  `PATH` makes the 5 `SchemaCLITests` fail with `FileNotFoundError:
  'textforensics'` — a harness artifact, not a repo defect.

## Full test suite

Command (venv `bin/` on `PATH`):

```bash
python -m pytest tests/ -q -p no:cacheprovider \
  --cov=src/textforensics --cov-report=term -o addopts=''
```

Result: **2210 passed, 147 skipped, 0 failed in 116.59 s.**
Coverage: **78%** (12420 statements, 2491 missed, 4016 branches,
525 partial).

The 147 skips are tests for optional extras not installed by `.[dev]`
(e.g. `typer`/`fastapi`-gated CLI and web-UI tests skip with
"fastapi not installed"); 2357 tests were collected in total.

Lowest-coverage core modules at this commit (from the same run):
`typer_cli.py` 0% (typer extra not installed — its tests skip),
`web_ui/main.py` 2% (fastapi extra not installed — its tests skip),
`ollama.py` 62%, `casefile.py` 70%, `_build_info.py` 70%,
`cli.py` 72%, `workspace_integrity.py` 73%, `model_card.py` 79%,
`bundle.py` 87%, `detection_cache.py` 89%.

## Lint / format

```bash
ruff check src/ tests/ scripts/   # All checks passed (0 errors)
ruff format --check src/ tests/ scripts/  # 225 files already formatted
```

## Static security scan

```bash
python -m bandit -r src/        # 16 Low, 0 Medium, 0 High
python -m bandit -r src/ -lll   # exit 0 (no medium/high findings)
```

## Dependency audit

```bash
python -m pip_audit --format json --desc=on   # exit 1: findings present
```

**25 findings in 3 packages** (all have a fixed version available):

| Package | Installed | Findings | Fixed in |
|---------|-----------|---------:|----------|
| cryptography | 42.0.8 | 11 | 43.0.1 – 49.0.0 depending on advisory |
| pip | 24.0 | 12 | 25.3 – 26.2 |
| pytest | 8.4.2 | 2 | 9.0.3 |

Notes:

- `cryptography` is pinned `<43` by the `enterprise` extra, which
  forces the vulnerable 42.x line. Dependabot PR #27 widens the cap;
  it is merged in Phase 4, after the history rewrite lands and CI is
  green — it is not silently upgraded here.
- `pip` 24.0 is the virtualenv's own installer, not a shipped project
  dependency.
- `pytest` 8.4.2 is a dev-only dependency.

## Schema validation

```bash
python scripts/validate_schemas.py   # 5 OK
```

The top-level `schemas/` duplicate was deleted in Phase 1; the packaged
`src/textforensics/schemas/` is the single source of truth, asserted by
`tests/test_precommit.py`.

## Claims gate

```bash
python scripts/check_claims.py   # All claims verified (exit 0)
```

The gate runs each claim's evidence (pytest for `test` claims, the
command for `command` claims) and fails on any `unverified`/`false`/
`stale` claim or missing evidence.

## Phase 1 security fixes verified by tests

- Web UI: `tests/test_web_ui.py` — `GET /` renders 200 with the session
  id (Starlette 1.10 `TemplateResponse` signature).
- Emergency stop: `tests/test_workspace_integrity.py` — identity lookup
  never fails headless (`getpass.getuser()` fallback).
- Ollama SSRF guard: `tests/test_ollama.py` — non-loopback `base_url`
  rejected without `allow_remote_host=True`; 10 MB response cap.
- Archive bombs: `tests/test_bundle.py::DecompressionCapTests` — real
  11 MB zero-filled zip/tar.gz bombs (compressed to ~10 KB) rejected.
- Cache bombs: `tests/test_detection_cache.py::TestDeserializeCaps` —
  oversized zlib expansion rejected.

## What is NOT verified here

- RAID / DetectRL / M4 benchmark integration: only placeholder READMEs
  exist under `benchmarks/`; no loader or run artifact. The old
  `partially_verified` claims were deleted, not restated. Real
  integration is Phase 3 work.
- Python 3.11 / 3.13 / 3.14 / 3.15: only 3.12.3 was run locally. Those
  versions are in the CI matrix (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`); local
  verification on them is not claimed.
- Human false-positive rate: no human-FPR evidence exists yet. It is a
  Phase 5 release gate (AGENTS.md rule 10), not a claim made here.
- Live-host Docker/API/web verification: not run in Phase 1. Phase 5.
